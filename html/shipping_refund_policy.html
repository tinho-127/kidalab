        <br><br>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
        </h5>   
        <h4>Furthermore, please check your shipping option! Most carriers do not deliver on weekends.</h4>
